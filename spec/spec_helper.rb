  # Seed global randomization in this process using the `--seed` CLI option.

  # test failures related to randomization by passing the same `--seed` value
  # as the one that triggered the failure.

  # assertions if you prefer.

  # rspec-mocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double
  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
